<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>I. The Qualifications Proposed For Senators, As Distinguished From Those Of Representatives, Consist In A More Advanced Age And A Longer Period Of Citizenship. A Senator Must Be Thirty Years Of Age At Least; As A Representative Must Be Twenty-five. And The Former Must Have Been A Citizen Nine Years; As Seven Years Are Required For The Latter. The Propriety Of These Distinctions Is Explained By The Nature Of The Senatorial Trust, Which, Requiring Greater Extent Of Information And Stability Of Character, Requires At The Same Time That The Senator Should Have Reached A Period Of Life Most Likely To Supply These Advantages; And Which, Participating Immediately In Transactions With Foreign Nations, Ought To Be Exercised By None Who Are Not Thoroughly Weaned From The Prepossessions And Habits Incident To Foreign Birth And Education. The Term Of Nine Years Appears To Be A Prudent Mediocrity Between A Total Exclusion Of Adopted Citizens, Whose Merits And Talents May Claim A Share In The Public Confidence, And An Indiscriminate And Hasty Admission Of Them, Which Might Create A Channel For Foreign Influence On The National Councils.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
