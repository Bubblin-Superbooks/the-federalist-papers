<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Iii. The Equality Of Representation In The Senate Is Another Point, Which, Being Evidently The Result Of Compromise Between The Opposite Pretensions Of The Large And The Small States, Does Not Call For Much Discussion. If Indeed It Be Right, That Among A People Thoroughly Incorporated Into One Nation, Every District Ought To Have A Proportional Share In The Government, And That Among Independent And Sovereign States, Bound Together By A Simple League, The Parties, However Unequal In Size, Ought To Have An Equal Share In The Common Councils, It Does Not Appear To Be Without Some Reason That In A Compound Republic, Partaking Both Of The National And Federal Character, The Government Ought To Be Founded On A Mixture Of The Principles Of Proportional And Equal Representation. But It Is Superfluous To Try, By The Standard Of Theory, A Part Of The Constitution Which Is Allowed On All Hands To Be The Result, Not Of Theory, But "Of A Spirit Of Amity, And That Mutual Deference And Concession Which The Peculiarity Of Our Political Situation Rendered Indispensable." A Common Government, With Powers Equal To Its Objects, Is Called For By The Voice, And Still More Loudly By The Political Situation, Of America. A Government Founded On Principles More Consonant To The Wishes Of The Larger States, Is Not Likely To Be Obtained From The Smaller States. The Only Option, Then, For The Former, Lies Between The Proposed Government And A Government Still More Objectionable. Under This Alternative, The Advice Of Prudence Must Be To Embrace The Lesser Evil; And, Instead Of Indulging A Fruitless Anticipation Of The Possible Mischiefs Which May Ensue, To Contemplate Rather The Advantageous Consequences Which May Qualify The Sacrifice.</h4></div> </div>
